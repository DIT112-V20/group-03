## What are we making?

We decided to build a remote control system for driving the car with the ability to detect and avoid hitting the obstacles on its way.
The system utilizes a web application to let the user drive the car through the streaming video which the system gets from a camera attached to the car.
Once the car detects any obstacles it stops and chooses a new free direction.


## Why are we making it? What problems does it solve?

It is often the case that we must be somewhere, but it is not safe for humans. Examples such as land mine detection, exploring mars, or, in 2020, for the elderly to go to the supermarket.
We believe that these situations could be improved if an affordable remotely controlled vehicle can carry out a task, in the place of a human. 
We would, therefore, like to develop an accessible and affordable remotely controlled vehicle platform, which can be adapted to meet all of these requirements.
Further inspired by the lastest coronavirus situation, we are not being able to meet in person as a team to work on the car, and team members have different mobile and desktop OS,
and software preferences, therefore, we have decided to build a web application, to ensure that our platform is accessible to as many as possible. 
This platform for remotely driving a car can be further developed in future projects to be applied on larger cars or robots.



## How are we going make it?

We will develop a java based web application, with a Spring based GUI in IntelliJ, to stand as the user-facing application. 
We will further use the Arduino IDE to develop the application that runs on the ESP32 on the car, as this is a platform that can be easily expanded for future development.
In order for the application running on the car, and the user-facing application to communicate with one another, we will develop the java application to be run on a server, 
which the car can reach, so long as it has a WiFi connection.
