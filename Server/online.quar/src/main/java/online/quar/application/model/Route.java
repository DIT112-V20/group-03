        notes:      TODO create a "Record this rout" button in UI
                        TODO have a failsafe to make sure user cant record something like driving against a wall - simple MSG that outputs to user: "your driving is silly - rout recording canceled"   - see line 11 for prototype suggestion
                    TODO implement a method that records the movments of the joystick (inside the class that controlls the car somewhere)
                    AND  bundels them with a time stamp - whatever our refresh rate on the joystick is - is probobly good enough (wouldnt want a rout to have milions of miniture ajustments - but wouldnt want it to only go in 30Â° turns - looking 'challenged')
                        TODO create a new rout when clicked (save somewhere? we can have a single "record rout" "play rout" save slot inside this class - to keep it simple or to prototype
                        TODO have the integrated direction/speed and time stamp added to the 2d array

            TODO do we have a direction/speed object? should we have one? wouldnt that help?
